### Survey Overview

The World Economic Forum Future of Jobs Report, published January 7th, 2025, is a series of visualizations and analysis based on a privately conducted survey of 1043 companies worldwide which have 500 or more employees. The survey was provided in 12 languages and the companies surveyed represent 22 industry types and 55 economical regions (generally referring to a single country but in some cases a collection of countries).

### Survey Contents

The survey is divided into 5 primary sections, each focusing on a slightly different aspect of how labor is expected to change between the years 2024 and 2030. The sections are as follows:

* Business Trends 2024-2030 - Examines macrotrends, especially the rate that technology (primary AI Large Language Models) are being adapted into different industries.
* Occupational Trends 2024-2030 - Examines Job Role definitions and how these continue to change as new technologies are adapted in different sectors.
* Skill Trends 2024-2030 - Identifies skills that are becoming higher demand and looks at trends in employees upskilling to adapt to a changing workplace.
* Workforce Practices 2024-2030 - Examines how a workplace at a mangement level deals with talent acquisition and development.
* People and Technology - Evaluates the level of automation and machine augmentation for various industries and task types.

A running theme throughout these sections is the adaptation of AI tools in various industries and comparing to see which fields are more succeptable to increased automation and potentially, removal of people entirely from certain task types. The report aims to identify areas that are changing the most significantly and rapidly as they adapt to new technologies and gather data about what employees in these fields are doing to keep up with the changing landscape.

### Relevace to this Project

The WEF Future of Jobs Report is a very insightful document for understanding emerging trends in not only job roles and required skills but also helpfully divides them by country and industry which is helpful for isolating information that is relevant depending on the question.

That said, the issue in terms of this project is the lack of availability of the source data. We can access the outputs of the survey and understand the trends that have been identified, but since we do not have access to the private, original survey results, there is only so much we can do with this information. The information is relevant and recommended to be read since it can guide future insight and routes of exploration for data analysis but the lack of a concrete accessible dataset lowers the value of the report for this project.

There are a few figures contained within the report with especially valuable insight on job roles and skills specifically that could be manually scraped into a helpful format and useful for other analysis tasks. These are identified below.

* Tables 5.6 and 5.7 near the end of the report provide a list of skills that were listed as important but were also given an importance score by industry which could provide an interesting set of weights beyond just a list of important skills.
* Additionally figure 4.12 has a percentage of employers based on how they do skill evaluation in their interview process (i.e. 82% of surveyed employers use work history as a way to evaluate skill evaluation and compatibility for a job).
* Figure 3.6 has a plot which maps industry by how much they value skills and whether they may increase in importance by the year 2030.
* Figure 3.3 is arguably the most relevant visualization to our purposes; it is the graph of just percentage of employers who think x skills is a core skill, which each skill color coded to a type of skills (ethics, management, etc.) While having the raw data here would be very helpful, at least having a percentage and a list of skills can be valuable to compile and cite.

### Conclusion

The report is rich with insightful data that covers a variety of industries and economies and provides a picture that lines up with insight that many people would naturally have: the world is changing rapidly and adaptation of new technologies is coming to a majority of industries and employees are confronting the importance of adaptation for survival.

While the survey data not being public is unfortunate, some of the insights from this report may be worth manually collecting as a resource to use in combination with the data being pulled from other sources.
